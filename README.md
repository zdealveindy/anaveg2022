# #AnaVeg2022: Analysis of vegetation ecology data in R: ordination, clustering, diversity and traits
### An online workshop organized by the IAVS Young Scientists Working Group  

&nbsp;

**Instructors:** David Zelený (Taiwan)
**Teaching Assistant:** Po-Yu Lin 林柏佑 (Taiwan)

**Dates:** April 2022 (five Saturdays, each lecture 3-hours long, 11:00-14:00 UTC - [check time at your location](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=AnaVeg2022&iso=20220402T11&p1=1440&ah=3))

&nbsp;

### Workshop overview
This online workshop focuses on commonly used methods for the analysis of vegetation data, including ordination, classification, analysis of diversity and traits. We will provide brief theoretical background, demonstrate how to use these methods in R, how to read the R output and correctly interpret it, what are the common mistakes and how to avoid them. We will combine brief theoretical parts, which will introduce the concept behind each method, with practical examples using real vegetation datasets. All course materials will be available online. Lectures will be provided live on Zoom, with possibility for direct interactions between lecturers, assistant and participants. Each lecture will be also recorded, and the recording will be available to registered participants for further review.

Active attendees who succeeded to complete the course (with score > 70%) will obtain a Course Certificate issued by the IAVS and signed by instructors.

This is a paid online workshop for both IAVS members and non-members (see below for details about the registration fee). Maximum capacity is 30 participants. We offer registration waivers for those in financial need; to apply for waiver, please fill the [Request for registration waiver form](https://forms.gle/CySyCEbAvitkkzGg6) (up to 10 waivers are available, only for IAVS members).

### What to prepare
Computer with installed R and RStudio, stable internet connection, headset and web camera for active participation. 

Before the course, please make sure that your computer has installed the latest version of R (version 4.1.2 or newer, installed from https://cran.rstudio.com/) and RStudio (2021.09.2, build 382 or newer, installed from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Check [here](https://anadat-r.davidzeleny.net/doku.php/en:r) for more details.

We expect you have basic skills in using the R programme, i.e. you know how to import libraries and data, create an object, subset object, create a loop and plot simple figures. If you are not familiar with R, we strongly suggest you complete [Quick R Introduction](https://www.davidzeleny.net/wiki/doku.php/quickr:start)** mini lectures before this workshop starts. 

### Preliminary programme
The workshop consists of five lecture blocks during April's Saturdays, each 3 hours long, with two 10-min breaks each. After each class, participants will get a homework assignment, with a deadline before the next class. We will also offer "Zoom office hours" for discussion with individual participants.
