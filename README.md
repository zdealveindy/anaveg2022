# Analysis of vegetation ecology data in R: ordination, clustering, diversity and traits
An online workshop organized by IAVS Young Scientists Working Group

Instructors: **David Zelený & Sergey Rosbakh**

Assistant: **Po-Yu Lin 林柏佑**

## Workshop overview
This workshop focuses on commonly used methods for the analysis of vegetation data, including ordination, classification, analysis of diversity and traits. We will provide brief theoretical background, demonstrate how to use these methods in R, how to read the R output and correctly interpret it, what are the common mistakes and how to avoid them. We will combine the brief theoretical parts, which will introduce the concept behind each method, with practical examples using real vegetation datasets. All course materials will be available online on a dedicated page.

Active attendees who succeeded to complete the course will obtain a Course Certificate. 

## Location
Online, using the Zoom platform. The link will be shared with registered participants.

## Schedule
Five blocks, each 3 hours long, with two 10-min breaks each. Homework assignment after each class, with a deadline before the next class. The last block will be used for the presentation and discussion of individual reports.

## What to prepare
Computer with installed R and RStudio, stable internet connection, headset and web camera for active participation. 

Before the course, please make sure that your computer has installed the latest version of R (version 4.1.2 or newer, installed from https://cran.rstudio.com/ and RStudio (2021.09.2, build 382 or newer, installed from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Check https://anadat-r.davidzeleny.net/doku.php/en:r for more details.

We expect you have the basic skills in using the R programme, i.e. you know how to import libraries and data, create an object, subset object, create a loop and plot simple figures. If you are not familiar with R, we strongly suggest you complete **[Quick R Introduction][quickr]** lectures before this workshop starts.
